# GUI Pwn - A Proof-of-Concept for GUI-Based UAC Bypass

## Overview

GUI Pwn is a proof-of-concept project developed to demonstrate the viability of a highly reliable GUI-based User Account Control (UAC) bypass. Traditionally, GUI bypasses have been deemed "inherently" unreliable. This project challenges that notion, providing a robust and consistent method for UAC bypass with a relatively low detection rate.
