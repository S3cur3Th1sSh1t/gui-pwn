# GUI Pwn

## Overview

GUI Pwn is a proof-of-concept project developed to demonstrate the viability of a highly reliable GUI-based User Account Control (UAC) bypass. Traditionally, GUI bypasses have been deemed "inherently" unreliable. This project challenges that notion, providing a robust and consistent method for UAC bypass with a relatively low detection rate.

Update 1/28/25: restored functionality since it looks like I won't get banned from github if its fully functional.
